# Hi there 👋 This is where I keep all my programming stuff 😄

- I often train through katas applying TDD since I was lucky to be trainee at [Lean Mind](https://leanmind.es/es/)
- I'm currently collaborating with BigeroData project where I'm developing software for Data engineering stuff and to handle IoT Devices (Raspeberry).
- In addition, in my free time I'm collaborating in other projects such as calculator app for [Mr Market Game](https://crowdfunding.boxlab.es/mr-market-game/3092)
